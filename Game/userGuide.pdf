Before starting the game, be sure to install the pymunk and pygame packages to the project

Next, navigate to game.py and run the file - navigate to the console and interact with the commands, and then the game will start.

To play the game, press SPACE to propel the ball upwards, making sure to avoid the blue pillars throughout the game.

One point will be added to your score every so often for surviving, and five points will be added to your score if you collide with a coin (yellow ball)

Survive in the game as long as possible, when the game ends your data will be stored and the game will quit.
